# Iteration 4 Retrospective
We definitely got a bit roadblocked on this iteration from user login. It was a bit difficult to all work on it together, as implementing the JHU login SSO using flask was very specialized and required even contacting our IT department. We were able to get the app deployed though, the backend on Heroku and the frontend on Netlify. The smart search feature started in iteration four is also not completed fully as of right now as it relies on having a userID to keep track of interactions/requests a user makes, but we should be able to implement the last few must-have features and nice-to-have features in this next ieration. 

## Potential Improvements
Some potential improvements we have in mind going forward are:
- Communicating with each other if there is an issue we run into
- Moving away from an extremely complex wway of implementing things, especially if they are high priority and maybe moving towards and easier implementation
- Finishing all required tasks by the deadline of the iteration
