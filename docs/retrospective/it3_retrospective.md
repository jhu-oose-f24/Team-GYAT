# Iteration 3 Retrospective
Iteration 3 is where we made the bulk of our progress so far. We were able to get images uploaded with jobs, pricing on jobs through using MetaMask, filtering of jobs by price and tags on jobs (tutoring, cleaning, etc.), being able to view detailed job information, and creating the backend for an in-app messaging service. The team worked well together and we were able to split up a lot of tasks to get most of our must-haves done during this iteration.

## Potential Improvements
Some potential improvements we have in mind going forward are:
- Making sure that each person is committing frequently and doing their part
- Helping each other out more when we need to to make sure everyone is up to speed
- Doing a better job of using more descriptive commit messages
- Finishing all required tasks by the deadline of the iteration
