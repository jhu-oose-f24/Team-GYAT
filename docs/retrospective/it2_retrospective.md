# Iteration 2 Retrospective
Overall, I feel like we progressed pretty well through iteration 2 and made a lot of improvements both on the frontend and backend. Specifically, we did a good job connecting the backend to the frontend, so that the data displayed on there is actually real data that the user created and saved.

## Potential Improvements
Some potential improvements we have in mind going forward are:
- Splitting up more featuers to implement among all of us
- Making sure that each person is committing frequently and doing their part
- Keeping the GitHub board up to date
- Helping each other out more when we need to to make sure everyone is up to speed
