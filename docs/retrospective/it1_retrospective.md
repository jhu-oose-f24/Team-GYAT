# Iteration 1 Retrospective

We did a good job of implementing early functionality, such as database setup, backend server creation, and a barebones frontend structure. We made important decisions like database schema, frontent library selection, and discussed more about how `provider`s and `requester`s will interact (and how to represent that both on the frontend and backend). Our strength going forward will be the continuous use of Slack as an open channel of communication.

## Potential Improvements
- Having other teammates approve pull requests. Because a lot of the logic in the first iteration was setup and not overly complex, we glossed over the practice of approving others pull requests. From now on, as the app grows in size and functionality, we will make sure that we are messaging each other in the slack group chat to make sure there are multiple sets of eyes on each pull request.
- We need to improve on our documentation across the board. We did a poor job updating the `README` and adding descriptions to tasks. In the next iteration, we will catch up on any documentation that may be lacking.
- Because the ball is already rolling, it will be easier to start work earlier on this iteration's assignments. We didn't complete everything we wanted to last iteration because we started late and it took us longer than expected to get organized.
